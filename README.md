# ProceduralDungeon

Procedurally generated maze written in C++ using directx11. 

A new maze is generated each time you play the game. where the goal is not to touch the walls and find the gold that is randomly placed on the maze.

Cellular Automata was used to generate the maze along with the use of A star to make sure the maze was solvable each time.
